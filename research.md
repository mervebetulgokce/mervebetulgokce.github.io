    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The experience of war and refugee status can alter intra-family dynamics and therefore have implications for family formation, including marriage. This study investigates marriage patterns among Syrian refugees in Turkey. Utilizing the nationally representative 2018 Turkey Demographic Health Survey (TDHS), we conduct a duration analysis of marriage outcomes among Syrian refugees in Turkey—tracking women throughout their residence in prewar Syria, postwar Syria, and Turkey. We find that early marriage is more prominent among refugees who were unmarried at the time of migration than those married before migration; the mean marriage age drops from 19.6 in prewar Syria to 19.1 in postwar Syria and 18.1 in Turkey. Using the TDHS and prewar Syrian surveys, we show that this finding aligns with the observed declines in household income and young women's opportunity cost of marriage. Our duration analysis also reveals a notable shift from traditional arranged marriages to more modern forms among refugees in Turkey. An intergenerational power shift may drive the shift toward non-arranged marriages. After arrival in Turkey, parental wealth and employment decline. In contrast, Syrian youth have higher age-adjusted employment rates than in prewar Syria. Moreover, for demographic groups with stronger intergenerational power shifts, non-arranged marriages increase more.

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This study investigates the impact of the Syrian civil war and refugee status on the risk of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) among Syrian women in Jordan, a country hosting a significant refugee population. We analyze data from the 2017-18 Jordan Population and Family Health Survey, which includes a nationally representative sample of Syrian refugees. Using the information on the timing of first violence after marriage within a discrete-time duration analysis, we examine the hazard rates of IPV exposure across di↵erent periods: prewar Syria, postwar Syria, and refugee status. Our findings demonstrate that war and refugee status increase the risk of IPV, with the most substantial impact observed in the initial years after marriage. Furthermore, the rise in IPV after the refugees’ arrival in Jordan diminishes over time. The study identifies the economic strain resulting from lower household wealth and refugee husbands’ employment losses as a driver of the rise in IPV. Moreover, our innovative approach utilizing GPS locations of refugee households to calculate refugee density reveals that greater social isolation, indicated by reduced proximity to other refugees, significantly exacerbates the risk of IPV among these women. In addition, we explore whether the civil war and refugee status alter marriage patterns, which could contribute to the observed e↵ects on IPV. Both the civil war and forced migration lower the marriage age and increase the incidence of non-cousin marriages at the expense of cousin marriages—both of which are associated with a higher risk of IPV. However, we observe no changes in age and education gaps between spouses or in polygamous marriages, which could also contribute to the observed increase in IPV.

### The Effect of Increasing Rental Prices on Student Mobility Patterns in Turkish Higher Education
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
In an era where economic factors increasingly influence educational choices, this study offers a criti- cal examination of how rental price variations impact student mobility in Turkish universities. This issue is particularly pertinent given the annual decision faced by nearly a million students in Turkey, whether to stay local or relocate for university education. Utilizing comprehensive datasets crawled from the Higher Education Council’s Atlas, I have compiled seven-year panel data, capturing nearly 9,000 university departments each year. It evaluates the openness ratio of undergraduate programs to students from other provinces, considering student origins, inflation-adjusted rental indices from real estate databases, and statistics on dormitory capacities and student aid. The study isolates the poten- tial impacts of rental prices on student mobility patterns by introducing fixed effects for department, university, province, and year-specific factors. This study paves the way for comparative analyses and policy formulations in other locales grappling with the intersection of economic factors and educational migration.

### Location Decisions of Refugees: Evidence from the Country that Hosts the Most Refugees
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper examines the location decisions of Syrian refugees in Turkeythe largest refugee group in a single countryusing the annual variation in the distribution of Syrian refugees across 81 provinces of Turkey in the 2013-20 period. We examine the effects of host regions economic conditions such as income and employment opportunities, amenities such as educational and health infrastructure, geographical conditions such as distance to refugees origin regions as well as distance to the EU border, ethnic networks, as well as the political orientation of the host regions. We find that while economic and geographical factors play a key role, once these factors are controlled for, no evidence exists that amenities, ethnic networks, or political orientation of the host regions are important in refugees location decisions.
