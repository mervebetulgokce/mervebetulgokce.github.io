<p> Welcome! </p>

<p> I recently completed my PhD in Economics at <a href="https://bogazici.edu.tr/en-US/Index">Bogazici University</a>, Turkey, where I specialized in economic demography and applied microeconomics. 
    My research focuses on migration economics, economic demography, and family economics, with a strong commitment to producing evidence-based, causal research that informs policy-making.
