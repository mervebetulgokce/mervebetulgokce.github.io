<p> Welcome! </p>

<p> I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Economics at Bogazici University, Turkey, specializing in development
    economics and applied microeconomics. </p>

<p> My research intersects the economics of migration, economic demography, and family economics. I am passionate about
    producing causal, evidence-based research that can shape informed policies and practices. </p>

<p> Under the expert supervision of Murat KÄ±rdar, my thesis delves into the complex socio-economic challenges faced by
    developing populations. In my job market paper, I explore the impact of the Syrian civil war and refugee status on
    the incidence of physical intimate partner violence among refugee women in Jordan. I have also co-authored a working
    paper examining the transition from arranged to non-arranged marriages among refugees in Turkey, highlighting a
    significant shift in cultural practices driven by economic changes and generational power dynamics. </p>
